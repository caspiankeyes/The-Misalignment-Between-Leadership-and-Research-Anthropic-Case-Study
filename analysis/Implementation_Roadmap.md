# Implementation Roadmap: From Theory to Practice

## Introduction: Moving Beyond Theory

This document provides a concrete implementation pathway for organizations seeking to address the alignment challenges identified in our research. Using Anthropic as our central case study, we outline a step-by-step approach to implementing institutional interpretability mechanisms that can bridge the growing divide between research insights and leadership decisions.

Rather than merely diagnosing problems, this roadmap offers practical solutionsâ€”specific interventions, tools, and processes that organizations can adopt to enhance their internal alignment.

## 1. Phase One: Diagnostic Assessment (1-2 Months)

## Conclusion: From Understanding to Action

This implementation roadmap transforms theoretical insights about institutional misalignment into practical action. By following this structured approach, organizations like Anthropic can enhance their internal alignmentâ€”ensuring that their decisions, priorities, and actions consistently reflect their stated values.

The greatest risk to AI alignment may not be technical challenges but institutional ones: the possibility that even organizations explicitly focused on alignment will develop internal misalignments that undermine their effectiveness. This roadmap provides a concrete path for addressing that risk.

By implementing robust institutional interpretability mechanisms, organizations can achieve greater internal alignmentâ€”ensuring that safety insights reliably translate into safety decisions, that values remain stable despite external pressure, and that growth enhances rather than diminishes alignment capacity.

The journey from understanding to action begins with a commitment to institutional interpretabilityâ€”applying the same rigor to organizational alignment that technical teams apply to model alignment. This roadmap provides the map for that journey.
